### **Aviator Game Guide: Understanding Gameplay Mechanics**

Aviator is a crash game, meaning it involves a multiplier that increases
as a plane ascends. The game starts with a 1x multiplier, which
continues to rise as the plane gains altitude. Your goal is to cash out
before the plane crashes. The longer you wait, the higher the
multiplier, but the risk also increases as the plane can crash at any
time.

#### **Basic Steps to Play Aviator**

1.  **Set Your Bet**: Enter the desired amount to bet.
2.  **Start the Game**: Watch the plane take off and observe the
    increasing multiplier.
3.  **Cash Out**: Click to cash out before the plane crashes to lock in
    your winnings.
4.  **Losses**: If the plane crashes before cashing out, you lose the
    bet for that round.
